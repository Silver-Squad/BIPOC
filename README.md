# Diversify

## Description
This application focuses on improving diversity in the workplace. Employees can research companies to gage how diverse a certain company is or isn't and check to see if that company is working on improving their Diversity & Inclusion practices. Companies can submit information on their D&I initiatives, take the Diversify D&I Quiz to see what areas they need to improve on, and find resources on how to improve their D&I.

## Planning Story
This project was created by a team of General Assembly UX/UI and Software Engineer Alum who gathered together for the 2021 Summer Hackathon.

Our prompt was: "How might we increase BIPOC representation on leadership teams at small tech companies (50-500 employees)?"

After discussion and research, we choose two main areas of focus:
1. How to make D&I information and BIPOC representation in companies transparent and easy for job seekers to find
2. Provide resources to support both users and companies to create comfortable, diverse, and inclusive workplaces
